# travelog

I don't consider myself a traveller as such, but if I get any chance to plan a trip with my friends or family, I do it without any second thoughts. Consequently, I have been able to travel a few places in India and around.

I enjoy travelling, visiting all the touristy spots and trying out some local food.

In this travelog I wish to recreate a few memories through a small tale and the picturesque sceneries captured by us.
