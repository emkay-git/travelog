Reached Banglore. Picked Zoomcar. And hit the road. Ooty, Mysore, Coorg we were coming. <br> Every place we visited, I hadn't seen anything similar. I saw the Mysore Palace. Stood in the middle of the Tea Garden on mountains from where I could see the endless clouds below me. Rode the toy Train. Always wanted to. (It wasn't that exciting though).Then there was The pretty lake, The Tea Factory, The elephants so close. Golden temple of the South was indeed impressive. But the visual treat to the eyes was when the Mysore palace lit its 1lakh bulbs. Just beautiful.  <br> And yes all this happened just a few weeks before everything stood still in India. Hoping to start another road trip soon. Writing another story soon.",
